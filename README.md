# code-camp-algorithms
Small project to demonstrate freeCodeCamp's algorithm challenges

## Getting Started
Simple clone this repo to your project directory of choice

`git clone https://github.com/meerkat79/code-camp-algorithms.git`

Then run: `npm install`

to add small webserver for convenience.
Next run: `http-server`

from any command terminal

The project will now be on `localhost:8080`

or you can also view the ip address provided by the command terminal

## Final Notes
This is a very basic implementation of the algorithm challenges as found on: https://www.freecodecamp.org
There may very well be some bugs in terms of unintended results. Please be sure to raise them under the issues section for the repository.
Better yet, if you like this little experiment and would like to get involved in maintaining any merge requests or bug fixes let me know and I can add you as a contributor!

Happy coding :)
